/**
 * a) - A program divided into smaller files will probably be easier to read and understand
 * - it is easier for multiple people to work on the project without stepping on each 
 * other's toes since they can be working in separate files.
 * 
 * b) - This can lead to longer compilation times since there might be more files to compile 
 * and link.
 * - Because of the many files that need to be compiled, there might be complicated compilation
 * steps that need to be set up and understood.
